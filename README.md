# NatureProject
A "game" created as final project for Research in Biodiversity, Ecology, and Conservation Lab course. We were tasked with creating a creative project that encompassed everything we learned that semester.

-This game allows the user to use arrow keys to explore the map and find all the different organisms found in the Smith College ecosystem. 
-I was inspired by my experience using the Seek app by INaturalist for a seperate project in the same course.
